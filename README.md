# Fall-Simulation
Simulating a square's Free Fall in Python

The simulation is created using Tkinter module (originally intended for UI's). <br />
It makes the 'fall' more realistic by changint it's speed according to fall time.<br />

There still are major issue though....
- You can't spawn-in more than one square :/

This project took two weeks to code from 0, it's open to contributions. Help us **make it better**! ^^
